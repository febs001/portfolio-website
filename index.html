        <h4>Thanks for visiting my site! </h4>
        <p>I'm a third year Computer Science (B.S) + Philosophy (B.A) major at the University of Minnesota-Duluth set to graduate May 2021. I am passionate about the emerging intersections between Artificial Intelligence & ethics, & strive to contribute to the field.
        I am researching various philosophical topics as applied to AI & ethics, & have recently presented one of my current projects at the International Association for Computing and Philosophy 2019 conference in Mexico City. As of now, I am working on my departmental honors thesis on a related topic to defend Fall 2019. In addition, I am currently working on theoretical computer science research utilizing Epistemic Modal Logic in order to create a probabilistic logic for a model of belief flow and influence in social networks.
        </p>
        <p><br>Besides academics, I am invested in community education outreach. My most recent experiences include being a tutor/youth mentor for Neighborhood Youth Services, a non-profit organization based in Duluth Minnesota to assist under-privledged youth in academics and career exploration. I have also had experience developing a programming curriculum in Java for Girl Scout Coders as an initiative to inspire female-identifying youth to explore programming.</p>
